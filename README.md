ï»¿# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

This Refactoring Kata was designed by Jon Jagger and is available in his Cyber-Dojo. See [his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html)

I have changed it a little, so that the rules more closely match the original game.
